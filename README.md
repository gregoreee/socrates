You've gone back in time to 500BC Athens and Socrates wants you to build him an app to help classify animals.

1. Build the classes Animal, Cat, and Bug.

2. Define the properties "color" and "leg_number" on the relevant and necessary classes. Have them be initialized within a constructor.

3. Add the functionality that would allow us to call a method "move" with the Cat and Bug classes. Have the method return a string "I'm moving with <number of legs> legs!", with the "<number of legs>" being leg_number as set on the class.

4. Add a new class called Bird. Add the property "can_fly". 
  
5. Add the functionality that would allow us to call a method "move" with the Bird class. Have the method return the string "I'm moving with <number of legs> legs!" if can_fly doesn't have an applicable value. If can_fly does have an applicable value, return the string "I'm flying".
